# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to LLM based coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## About the codebase

- This is a monorepo for Sugar SDK: a collection of typescript API bindings for underlying smart contracts
- It uses `npm` as a package manager


## Commands

- before running commands, make sure to activate appropriate node env using `nvm use`
- to build SDK use `cd packages/sugar-sdk && npm run build`
- to run tests use `npm test`

## Workflow

- carefully study the task that is given to you
- come up with a plan
- execute the plan
- try to confirm if results look good
- run tests to verify the integrity of the system
- if test fails, iterate on the solution until all tests pass

## Tech stack

TODO - fill this out

## Code Style Guidelines

TODO - might drop this altogether in favor of lints via hooks

## Documentation

## Architecture Guidelines

TODO - should talk about primitives here and any additional stuff that comes up

### Key Concepts:

TODO - might need to mansplain some stuff to Claude
